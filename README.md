# **Data Analysis Portfolio Project**
Contained within this "Portfolio Projects" folder are four different projects displaying my skills within the Data Analysis field. This Readme describes each project that can be accessed via the sections contained in this Readme or via the links above.

## Apple TV Analysis
[The following project can be found on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/AppleTVDataAnalysis/AppleTVDataAnalysis?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) and the .tbw file can be found [here](Apple_TV_analysis.twb).

For this project I analysed data from Apple TV, which contained Films and TV Shows that are shown on Apple TV. I initially cleaned the data in Microsoft Excel and then brought it into Tableau, where I created visualisations for the data and answered questions related to this data. I also mentioned a few other questions I would want to have answered if I had access to more data about these shows.

## TMDB Data Analysis
For the following project I used [Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) to analyse a [huge dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies/data) with data scraped TMDB, containing close to 1 million rows of films. A project of this scale would not be possible in Excel and would require using SQL.

For this project I answered many questions that would be helpful to learn about this dataset, such as which genres on average have the highest budgets and which movies have the highest return on their investments. Each SQL query contains comments above it explaining what the query does.

The .sql file for this project can be found [here](TMDB_Data_Analysis.sql).

## Top 100 Grossing Movies Analysis

In this project I exclusively used Microsoft Excel to clean, analyse and visualise data from on [a dataset I found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sanjeetsinghnaik/grossing-movies-eda-2023). While it wasnâ€™t feasible to clean this dataset entirely, and as I explained in the accompanying [explainer document](Excel_Top_100_Grossing_Films.docx) I would have contacted the source for them to try and re-scrape the data, I was still able to adequately clean it and demonstrated how I can use Excel to visualise data and answer questions.

The document explaining my process of creating the visualisations for this project can be found [here](Excel_Top_100_Grossing_Films.docx) and the .xlsx file can be found [here](Excel_Top_100_Grossing_Films.xlsx).

## COVID Follow Along Project
For the following SQL based project I followed along to a [tutorial created by AlexTheAnalyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM)

For this project I used [Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) to analyse COVID deaths data from two "Our World In Data" datasets. While following along to the above video I pulled out certain columns from the datasets and used them to display certain data as is specified by the comments within the COVIDFollowAlong.sql file.

The SQL file for this project can be found [here](COVIDFollowAlong.sql)
